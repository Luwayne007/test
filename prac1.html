<h1>My GitHub Cheat Sheet </h1>


<h2>Basic branching</h2>
<div class="boxed">
<p>
When working with a centralized workflow the concepts are simple,
master represented the official history and is always deployable.
With each now scope of work, aka feature, the developer is to create a
new branch. For clarity, make sure to use descriptive names like
transaction-fail-message or github-oauth for your branches.
#Protip: Although you may have a feature like 'user login and registration
`, this is not considered appropriate to create a feature branch at this
level, there is too much work to be done. It is better to break these large
deliverables down to smaller bits of work that can be continuously
integrated into the project. Remember, commit early and often.
Before you create a branch, be sure you have all the upstream changes
from the origin/master branch.

<h2>Make sure you are on master</h2>
<div class="boxed">
<p>
Before I pull, I make sure I am on the right branch.
I have GIT Bash autocompletion installed, this tells me the
branch in the prompt. Otherwise, the following command is good to know
to list out the branches I have locally as well designate which branch
I am currently on.

<h2>The Pull request</h2>
<div class="boxed">
<p>
The pull request is where the rubber meets the road.
As stated previously, one of the key points of the feature
branch workflow is that the developer who wrote the code does
ot merge the code with master until there has been a peer review.
Leveraging Github's pull request features, once you have completed
the feature branch and pushed it to the repo, there will be an
option to review the diff and create a pull request.
In essence, a pull request is a notification of the new code in an
experience that allows a peer developer to review the individual
updates within context of the update. For example, if the update was
on line 18 of header.haml, then you will only see header.haml and a few
lines before and after line 18.
This experience also allows the peer reviewer to
place a comment on any line within the update.
This will be communicated back to the editor of origin.
This review experience really allows for everyone on the team to
be actively involved in each update.
Once the reviewer has approved the editors updates,
there are two ways to merge in the code. One from the
Github interface and another from the command line.
